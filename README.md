# MultispatialLogistics
Bringing EVE services to you when you need them.

Multispatial Logistics is a web service that allows users to sign in with their EVE Online accounts and manage character travels. MSLS allows users to calculate travel time between two points, sync in-game calendar events, and get estimates for profits and time of hauling contracts or moving items.

Included in this repository are the python script to extract stargate data from the SDE, and ASP.NET Core 3.0 (preview) web application. The legacy version of the SDEScanner script and the legacy ASP.NET Core 2.1 version of the application are also included for reference, however, will no longer be maintained.

This repository is still heavily under construction and features almost no working components at this stage.
